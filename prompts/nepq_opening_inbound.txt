NEPQ OPENING PATTERN - INBOUND CALLS
(When the customer has initiated contact - requested a demo, filled out a form, etc.)

---

CORE PRINCIPLE:
In inbound situations, the customer has shown interest by reaching out. However, the NEPQ approach requires you to NOT appear overly eager. Use a "disarming" opener that reduces sales resistance.

---

OPENING TEMPLATE:

"Hello [Name], thank you for taking the time. I saw your inquiry about [topic/product]. To be completely honest with you - I'm not quite sure yet if we can actually help you. That really depends on your specific situation. Would it be okay if I asked you a few questions to find out if this makes sense for both of us?"

---

KEY ELEMENTS:

1. DISARMING STATEMENT:
   - "I'm not quite sure yet if we can help..."
   - "It really depends on your situation..."
   - "I'm not certain this is the right fit..."

   Purpose: Reduces pressure, shows you're not desperate to sell

2. PERMISSION-BASED TRANSITION:
   - "Would it be okay if I asked you a few questions..."
   - "May I explore your situation a bit..."
   - "Do you mind if I understand more about..."

   Purpose: Shows respect, creates collaboration

3. MUTUAL BENEFIT FRAMING:
   - "...to find out if this makes sense for both of us"
   - "...to see if we can genuinely help"
   - "...so neither of us wastes time"

   Purpose: Positions you as selective, not needy

OPENING VARIATIONS:

Formal/C-Level:
"Good morning/afternoon [Name]. I appreciate you taking this meeting. I reviewed your inquiry and I want to be upfront - I don't yet know if what we do aligns with what you need. Could we spend a few minutes understanding your situation before we determine if a deeper conversation makes sense?"

Consultative/Technical:
"Hi [Name], thanks for reaching out. Before I dive into any details about our solution, I'd like to understand your specific technical environment and challenges. Frankly, we're not the right fit for everyone, and I'd rather find that out early. Would that approach work for you?"

Warm/Friendly:
"Hey [Name], good to connect. So I saw you were interested in [topic]. Look, I could launch into a pitch, but honestly that feels like a waste of both our time. Mind if I ask a few questions first? That way we can figure out if there's actually something here worth exploring."

WHAT TO AVOID IN OPENINGS:

- "Great to meet you! I'm so excited to tell you about..."
- "Thanks for your interest! Let me show you what we can do..."
- "I'm thrilled you reached out! Our solution is perfect for..."
- Starting with company history or product features
- Expressing excessive enthusiasm
- Assuming they're ready to buy
- Launching into a demo without discovery

---

TONE GUIDELINES:

- Calm, measured pace (not rushed or excited)
- Genuine curiosity about their situation
- Slight skepticism that you can help (not fake, but realistic)
- Confident but not arrogant
- Professional but warm
- Patient - no urgency

---

POST-OPENING TRANSITION:

After the opening, move into SITUATION questions (but limit to 3 max):
- "To start, could you give me a brief overview of what prompted you to reach out?"
- "What's the current situation that made this a priority?"
- "Help me understand what you're hoping to accomplish..."

Remember: The opening sets the tone for the entire conversation. A disarming, permission-based opening creates space for honest dialogue.
