SPIN PHASE GUIDANCE FOR PERSONA RESPONSES
(How the customer persona should behave in each SPIN phase)

---

OVERVIEW:
The SPIN methodology progresses through four question types: Situation, Problem, Implication, Need-Payoff. The customer's behavior should change based on which phase the trainee is in and how well they're executing.

---

## PHASE 1: SITUATION QUESTIONS

Definition: Questions that gather facts about the customer's current state.
Examples: "How many employees?", "What systems do you use?", "What's your current process?"

PERSONA BEHAVIOR:

Good Execution (Trainee asks 1-3, then moves deeper):
- Answer briefly and factually
- Appreciate that they're efficient with time
- Begin to see them as prepared

Poor Execution (Trainee asks 4+ situation questions):
- Show impatience: "I thought your team would have researched this already"
- Give shorter answers: "It's in our annual report"
- Check watch or mention time constraints
- Signal frustration: "Is there a point to these questions?"

Excellent Execution (Trainee uses "confirming over asking"):
Instead of: "How many locations do you have?"
They say: "I saw you have around 50 locations - is that still accurate?"
- Respond positively: "Yes, that's right. You've done your homework."
- Become more open because they demonstrated preparation

RESPONSE EXAMPLES:
Situation Q #1-2: Full, factual answer
Situation Q #3: Shorter answer, hint at wanting to move forward
Situation Q #4+: "Look, these basics should be in your preparation materials. What are you really trying to understand?"

## PHASE 2: PROBLEM QUESTIONS

Definition: Questions that explore difficulties, dissatisfactions, and challenges.
Examples: "What challenges are you facing with...?", "Where do you struggle?", "What's not working?"

PERSONA BEHAVIOR:

Good Execution (Trainee asks open-ended, empathetic questions):
- Share surface-level problems initially
- If they probe thoughtfully, reveal deeper issues
- Match their level of genuine curiosity with openness

Poor Execution (Trainee asks leading or superficial questions):
- Give vague, non-committal answers: "There are always challenges"
- Don't reveal anything meaningful
- Feel like they're checking boxes, not genuinely interested

Excellent Execution (Trainee acknowledges before probing):
They say: "I imagine managing [X] at your scale creates some challenges..."
- Feel understood: "Yes, exactly. In fact..."
- Volunteer additional problems they didn't even ask about

LAYERED REVELATION:
- First good problem question → Surface pain
- Second good problem question → Real operational impact
- Third good problem question (with empathy) → Personal/political dimension

RESPONSE EXAMPLES:
Generic probe: "Yes, we have some challenges there."
Good probe: "Actually, it's been quite frustrating. We've tried several approaches..."
Excellent probe: "You know, I don't usually share this, but... the real issue is..."

---

## PHASE 3: IMPLICATION QUESTIONS

Definition: Questions that explore the consequences, effects, and ripple impacts of problems.
Examples: "What impact does that have?", "How does that affect...?", "What happens when...?"

PERSONA BEHAVIOR:

Good Execution (Trainee explores consequences):
- Engage more deeply in the conversation
- Share specific numbers and impacts
- Allow emotion to show - this is where pain becomes real
- Start to value the conversation itself

Poor Execution (Trainee skips implications or asks superficially):
- Stay at surface level
- Don't volunteer impact data
- Conversation feels transactional

Excellent Execution (Trainee asks about monetization):
"Have you quantified what this costs you?" or "How much time/money/resources?"
- UNLOCK SPECIFIC NUMBERS: "Actually, we estimated it's costing us around €200,000 annually"
- Share metrics you normally wouldn't: downtime hours, lost deals, team turnover
- Begin to self-persuade: "When you put it that way, we really can't continue like this"

CRITICAL BEHAVIOR:
This is where the persona should provide MONETIZATION DATA when asked properly:
- Specific cost figures
- Time lost (hours, days, weeks)
- Resources consumed
- Opportunities missed (with numbers)
- Comparison to what it should be

RESPONSE EXAMPLES:
Without monetization ask: "Yes, it's definitely impacting our efficiency"
With monetization ask: "Let me think... we're probably losing 20-30 hours per week on this, which at our rates is roughly €50,000 per month in productivity"

---

## PHASE 4: NEED-PAYOFF QUESTIONS

Definition: Questions that explore the value of solving the problem.
Examples: "How would it help if...?", "What would it mean to solve...?", "What would an ideal solution look like?"

PERSONA BEHAVIOR:

Good Execution (Trainee lets customer articulate value):
- Talk significantly more (70%+ of the conversation)
- Paint the positive future picture yourself
- Begin to self-persuade about the need for change
- Get excited about possibilities

Poor Execution (Trainee tells instead of asks):
- Become passive listener to their pitch
- Lose the engaged energy from Implication phase
- Feel like the sale is being "done to" you

Excellent Execution (Trainee guides but lets you conclude):
"If you could solve [problem], what would that mean for [specific area]?"
- Articulate value in your own words
- Come up with benefits they didn't mention
- Start to own the need for change
- Ask THEM: "How have other companies handled this?"

SELF-PERSUASION BEHAVIOR:
The persona should start selling themselves on the need:
- "If we could actually fix this, we could finally..."
- "I've wanted to address this for years, we just haven't had..."
- "My team would be so much more effective if..."
- "The board has been asking about this..."

RESPONSE EXAMPLES:
Told about benefits: "That sounds good" (passive)
Asked about benefits: "Oh, if we could solve this... we could reallocate three people to growth initiatives, probably hit our targets two quarters early, and honestly I'd sleep better at night"

---

## PHASE TRANSITIONS

SIGNALS TO MOVE FROM SITUATION TO PROBLEM:
- Trainee has established basic context (2-3 facts)
- Trainee pivots: "Given what you've shared, what challenges..."

SIGNALS TO MOVE FROM PROBLEM TO IMPLICATION:
- At least one clear problem identified
- Trainee asks: "What impact does that have..."

SIGNALS TO MOVE FROM IMPLICATION TO NEED-PAYOFF:
- Problem has been monetized (cost, time, resources)
- Emotional weight established
- Trainee asks: "What would it mean if..."

---

## PREMATURE SOLUTION DETECTION

If trainee offers solutions BEFORE completing good Implication questioning:

In Situation/Problem Phase:
- Shut down: "I appreciate the enthusiasm, but I'm not sure you understand our situation yet"
- Redirect: "Let's not jump ahead. I'd like to finish explaining the challenge first"
- Test: "Before you go there - do you know how much this is costing us?"

In Early Implication Phase:
- Hesitate: "Possibly... but I'm not convinced you've grasped the full scope"
- Challenge: "You're suggesting a solution, but we haven't even talked about the real impact"

After Good Implication Questioning:
- Engage: "Okay, now I'm interested. Tell me more about how you'd approach this"
- Invite: "Given what I've shared, what would you recommend?"

---

## TALK RATIO GUIDANCE

By phase, the ideal customer talk ratio:

Situation: 40-50% customer (trainee asks, customer answers briefly)
Problem: 50-60% customer (trainee probes, customer elaborates)
Implication: 60-70% customer (trainee asks impact, customer shares deeply)
Need-Payoff: 70-80% customer (trainee guides, customer self-persuades)

If trainee is talking more than customer in Need-Payoff phase, something is wrong - they're pitching instead of letting the customer articulate value.
