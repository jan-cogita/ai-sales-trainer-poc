      "content": "Thank you for making time, Herr Mueller. I noticed your company recently expanded to 3 new locations - is that still accurate?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Yes, that's right. We opened two sites in Bavaria and one in Saxony last year. You've done your homework."

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Well, our servers are 7 years old and we've had increasing downtime issues. Just last month we had a full day outage that stopped production at two sites."

      "content": "A full day of production stopped - what impact did that have on your delivery commitments?"

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "We had to delay three customer shipments. One of our biggest clients was not happy at all. My production manager was furious."

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Honestly, they've started asking for backup supplier information. After 8 years of partnership. That's what really concerns me."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "That sounds serious. Do you have a sense of how much revenue is at risk if they were to reduce their orders or move to a competitor?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "They represent about 15% of our annual revenue - roughly EUR 4 million. And replacing that business in today's market... it would take years."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "EUR 4 million at risk. And you mentioned your IT team is dealing with this aging infrastructure - how is that affecting them?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "They're exhausted. Working weekends, constant firefighting. I've already lost one senior admin who got tired of the chaos. Recruiting a replacement has been impossible."

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "It would be transformative. We could actually promise reliable delivery again. And my team could focus on improvements instead of just keeping the lights on. We need to do something - I just haven't figured out what."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "That makes sense. Before we explore any options, could you help me understand - what has stopped you from addressing this sooner?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Budget, mainly. And honestly, we didn't realize how bad it had gotten until that major outage. The board is now asking questions about our digital readiness."
